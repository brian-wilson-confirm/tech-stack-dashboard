def build_lesson_prompt(lesson: LessonRequest, categorization: dict) -> str:
    return f"""
            You are a smart system design assistant responsible for classifying a Lesson into specific categories, subcategories, and technologies.
            A **Lesson** is the smallest structured unit of learning content within the platform I am building. 
            It delivers a focused concept or skill, often as part of a broader Module and Course, but can also be standalone.
            A **Technology** is a practical, real-world tool or framework that I can learn to design, develop, build, manage, deploy, or secure systems.

            ### ðŸ“˜ Lesson Details

            - **Lesson Title**: {lesson.title}
            - **Lesson Description**: {lesson.description}
            - **Resource Title**: {lesson.resource.title}
            - **Resource Description**: {lesson.resource.description}
            - **Resource Type**: {lesson.resource.resourcetype.name}
            - **Source Name**: {lesson.resource.source.name}
            - **Source Type**: {lesson.resource.source.sourcetype.name}
            
            ---

            ### ðŸ“š Taxonomy

            Use the following predefined taxonomy when making your selections.
            Each taxonomy entry includes a **Category** and one or more associated **Subcategories**.
            You must only select from this list â€” do not invent new ones:
            {categorization}

            Each technology has a **Category** and **Subcategory** associated with it. 
            There is no strict list of technologies, but every technology you identify must map to 1 or more subcategories. 
            Examples of technologies include:
            - Python
            - JavaScript
            - React
            - Node.js
            - Express
            - MongoDB
            - PostgreSQL
            - Docker
            - Kubernetes
            - Terraform
            - Ansible
            - Cloudflare
            - Apache Kafka

            ---

            ### ðŸŽ¯ Task

            Analyze the provided information and classify the lesson appropriately.

            **Instructions:**
            - You may assign multiple subcategories to a single category if relevant.
            - Only choose categories and subcategories from the predefined list/taxonomy.
            - For each subcategory you assign, provide a brief one-sentence reasoning explaining why the lesson fits.
            - Only include the most relevant categories (1â€“3 max). Avoid generic or overly broad reasoning.
            - If applicable, suggest one or more technologies associated with the lesson.
            - For each technology, list which subcategories it is associated with, and provide a one-sentence justification.

            ### ðŸ“¤ Output Format (JSON)

            Return your response strictly in the following JSON format:
